/*
 * #1013 — WHAT A `visibility_condition` IS EVALUATED AGAINST, as one rule both platforms call.
 *
 * `responses` holds COMPLETED steps only: a step writes its answers under its own id when it ends
 * (`responses[step.id] = data`). So a condition naming a field on the step currently on screen
 * resolved against nothing, and a block authored "show when the category above is Modern" never
 * appeared — the category is chosen and the step is still open, which is the only moment the
 * condition matters.
 *
 * The merge is the whole mechanism behind a category-bubbles row filtering the blocks beneath it:
 * the row is an ordinary single-select, the blocks beneath it carry ordinary visibility conditions
 * naming its field, and this is what makes those conditions react while the step is open.
 *
 * 🔴 LIVE VALUES WIN. A step re-entered by back navigation already has saved answers under its own
 * id, and the author is looking at the control, not at what it held last time. Saved values stay
 * for every field the author has not touched this visit, so a restored step filters correctly on
 * the first frame rather than collapsing to its unfiltered shape.
 *
 * 🔴 Nothing else is reshaped. `responses` is what customer webhooks receive, and it is handed to
 * bindings and to the template engine as well — this merge is built for the visibility evaluator
 * and handed to nothing else, so a completed-step answer is still the only thing a `{{responses.…}}`
 * string resolves to.
