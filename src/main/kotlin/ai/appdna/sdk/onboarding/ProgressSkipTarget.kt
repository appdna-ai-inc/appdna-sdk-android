/**
 * Where the progress bar's "Skip" link goes.
 *
 * 🔴 `OnboardingSettings.skip_to_step` WAS DECODED BY BOTH PLATFORMS AND READ BY NEITHER. It sits
 * one field away from `progress_skip_label`, and this link was the only thing it could have meant:
 * Skip advanced ONE step, which is indistinguishable from pressing the CTA, so a flow that offered
 * "Skip" walked the user through the rest of it anyway.
 *
 * 🔴 A SHARED RULE RATHER THAN THREE LINES IN EACH RENDERER, because three lines in each renderer
 * is exactly how a shared rule diverges: an elvis that returns early on one platform and an
 * `if let` that falls through on the other look identical in review and behave differently
 * (measured on a survey's follow-up, which never ran for precisely that reason). Both renderers
 * call this.
 *
 * Mirrors iOS `ProgressSkipTarget`.

     *  * a target naming a step that is not in this flow — a stale id after a step was renamed or
