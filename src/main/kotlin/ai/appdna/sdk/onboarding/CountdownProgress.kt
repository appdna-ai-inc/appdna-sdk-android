/**
 * How far a countdown has run, as a fraction of its own starting value — #1066.
 *
 * 🔴 BOTH PLATFORMS HAD THIS FROZEN AT 0.75. The `circular` variant's ring was a hardcoded
 * `sweepAngle = 270f` here and `trim(to: 0.75)` on iOS — the console preview's static mock, ported
 * into two renderers. The digits counted down while the ring never moved, and it was still at 75%
 * when the timer expired. A preview is allowed a frozen value because it has no clock; a renderer
 * is not.
 *
 * 🔴 THE DENOMINATOR IS THE CAPTURED INITIAL VALUE, not `duration_seconds`. A `fixed_datetime`
 * countdown starts partway through its own duration — a sale ending in 3 hours whose
 * `duration_seconds` says 24 — so dividing by the authored duration pins the indicator near 100%
 * for the whole countdown. That trap is why both renderers capture `initialSeconds` once.
 *
 * Mirrors iOS `CountdownProgress`.
